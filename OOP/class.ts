//* How to create a class and also instance of class in TS
//**************************************

//* A class in terms of OOP is a blueprint for creating objects.
//* A class is like a blueprint for creating similar things.

//? In TypeScript, there is a convention to use PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase) for
//? class names. This means that class names should start with a capital letter and each
//? subsequent word in the class name should also begin with a capital letter.
