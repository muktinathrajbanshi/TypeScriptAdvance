// * Type inference in TypeScript refers to the ability of the TypeScript compiler to automatically
// * determine and assign types to variables, expressions, and function return values based on their
// * usage and context in the code.

let myName = "muktinath";
let myFavNum = 5;
// myFavNum = true

// todo 👉 What are some best practices for using type inference in TypeScript?
//? Use type inference for simple cases where the assigned value clearly indicates the intended type.
//? When in doubt, provide explicit type annotations to make your intentions clear.
//? Avoid relying too heavily on type inference when the assigned value is complex or ambiguous.
//? Regularly review and refactor your code to ensure the inferred types align with your intentions.
