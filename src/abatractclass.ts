//* Abstract classes provide a way to define common properties and methods that multiple derived
//* classes can share. This promotes code reuse and helps establish a common interface for related
//* classes. Abstract class cannot be instantiated

//* Abstract classes focus on class inheritance and sharing common functionality, whereas the
//* useContext hook in React focuses on managing global state and allowing components to consume that
//* state.

//? Example : Shape Hierarchy
//? Suppose you're building a graphics application, and you want to create a hierarchy of different 
//? shapes. You can use an abstract base class Shape to define common properties and methods that all
//? shapes share..

//* Practice Time
//? You need to do the same for Square and Rectangle and if possible use getter and setter methods
//? members
