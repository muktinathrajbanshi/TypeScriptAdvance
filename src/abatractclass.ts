//* Abstract classes provide a way to define common properties and methods that multiple derived
//* classes can share. This promotes code reuse and helps establish a common interface for related
//* classes. Abstract class cannot be instantiated

//* Abstract classes focus on class inheritance and sharing common functionality, whereas the
//* useContext hook in React focuses on managing global state and allowing components to consume that
//* state.
