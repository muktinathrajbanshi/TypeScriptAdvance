// ********************************
//* STATIC PROPERTIES & METHODS
// ********************************

//* In TypeScript, static methods and properties belong to the class itself rather than to instance
//* of the class. By making methods and properties static, we can access them directly from the class
//* without needing to create an instance of the class. This is useful for utility functions or properties
//* that don't rely on instance-specific data.

//? Example: Math Operations Utility - creating a utility class to perform various methematical operations.
