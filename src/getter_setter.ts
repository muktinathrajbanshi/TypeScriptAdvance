//* ********************
//* GETTER & SETTER
//* ********************

//? In TypeScript classes, you can use getter and setter methods to control the access and modification
//? of class properties. Getter methods allow you to retrieve the value of a property, while setter 
//? methods allow you to set the value of a property with additional logic or validation.

//TODO The get method doesn't take any parameters, and the set method takes only one parameter.

//* PRACTICE TIME
//? Q1: Bank Account Balance
//* Create a TypeScript class BankAccount with a private property _balance initialized to 0.
//* Implement a getter method balance that returns the current balance.
//* Implement a setter method balance that updates the balance if the new value is non-negative. Otherwise,
//* log an error message.
//* Instantiate an object of the BankAccount class.
//* Use the setter to set the balance to 1000 and use the getter to display the updated balance.
//* Try setting a negative balance using the setter. What output do you expect?
