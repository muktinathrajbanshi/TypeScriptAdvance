//* ********************
//* GETTER & SETTER
//* ********************

//? In TypeScript classes, you can use getter and setter methods to control the access and modification
//? of class properties. Getter methods allow you to retrieve the value of a property, while setter 
//? methods allow you to set the value of a property with additional logic or validation.

//TODO The get method doesn't take any parameters, and the set method takes only one parameter.
