// * In TypeScript, tuples are a data structure that allows you to store a fixed-size collection of
// * elements of different types. They are similar to arrays, but with a key difference: the types of
// * elements in a tuple are fixed and declared at the time of creation, whereas arrays can hold elements
// * of the same type, and their size can vary.

//? Real-life example of using tuples in TypeScript:

//? Let's consider a scenario where you want to represent a person's basic information, including their
//? name, age, and whether they have a driver's license. Using a tuple can be an appropriate choice 
//? because these three elements have a specific order and type.
